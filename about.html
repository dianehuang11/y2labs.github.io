				<p> <div style="margin-top:10px"> The Y2 idea sprouted sponteneously back in May of 2015, when we looked around and saw an opportunity.
There were many organizations that offered programs that helped high-school students learn about business, but not with direct interaction and mentorship from entrepreneurs.
				</p> </div>
				<p>
Seeking a solution to this problem, Y2 was created. Through formal workshops (design thinking, building an investor pitch) with mentorship and coaching from entrepreneurs to offer an unparalleled learning experience for motivated innovative and entrepreneurial teens,
the Y2 program has helped more than 100 teens accelerate their personal development, and engaged more than 60 volunteer entrepreneurs from the Greater Toronto Area and York Region.
				</p>

				<h3 style="color:#77BFC1" class="major"> So where is Y2 now?</h3> 
				<p> Between the October 2015 and April 2016 conferences, there have been several highlights:
<ul> <li> More than 100 participants from 15 different high schools, including Oakville, Guelph and London </li>
	<li> 4 winning teams have met with their experienced entrepreneur "prize" mentors over dinner </li>
    <li> <a href="http://y2youth.org" target="_blank"> Proxi Meet </a> (Winner of Y2 Oct 2015) went on to win the Ontario Centres of Excellence's Make Your Pitch competition, which earned the team a $3000 grant and a place in the Summer Company program </li>
    <li> <a href="http://y2youth.org" target="_blank"> Candy Cutlery </a>(Winner of April 2016) went on to win the Ideal Incubator's Business Plan Competition, which earned the team $2500 in seed money and served on the Entrepreneurship panel at Ryerson DMZ. </li>
