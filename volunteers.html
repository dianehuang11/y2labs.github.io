    <p>
        <div style="margin-top:10px">
            Zmozynski said that the seeds of entrepreneurship and self-employment were planted in him as a young person, after witnessing the successes and lifestyle of his extended family. A positive experience in high school with Junior Achievement, made the option
            that much more realistic. After studying small business at a U.S. based Adventure Sports program, Chris returned to Ontario and obtained his BA after formally studying Economics and Administration at Trent University. His first passion is
            the Outdoor Adventure industry, but a close second is the world of small business.

            <p style="margin-top:20px">
                "Over the years I have been fortunate to teach Snowboarding, Backcountry-living, been a Canoe-guide, High ropes and Climbing instructor, as well as a Guide and Instructor for a Dirt-bike and trail-riding school. Public speaking, planning and executing
                goals as well as teamwork are critical in each of these. Similar to the start up world, these high risk environments can often be unpredictable and emotional, but more often than not, they bring out the best in people and many walk away
                stronger, more confident, and more self-reliant." </i>
            </p>
    </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        After a short 4 year stint in the corporate world, Chris fell back on his first interest and has never looked back. He worked in four large corporations over four years, and witnessed the exact opposite of what he had been trained to expect of healthy
        teams, and from professional leadership. Unfortunately that's the nature of things when the bottom line is measured solely by monitory gain; adults frequently act worse professionally than they would ever let their children behave publically.
        Since 2008, Chris has co-founded and run a profitable: Agri-brokerage, Construction Project Consulting and Project Management operation, as well as a Home Inspection Business. He is currently a founding partner in 2 separate but interrelated entities:
        a Property Development corporation as well as its proprietary software.
